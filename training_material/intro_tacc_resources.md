# SHADE AI Gym: TACC Compute and Storage Overview

## Prerequisites 

Sign up for a TACC user account here: https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/. After your account has been approved, enable Multi-factor Authentication by following the instructions [here](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication). 

Individual users have been added to the DARPA-SHADE project. You can view a list of projects associated with your account by logging into the [portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/) and selecting 'Projects and Allocations' from the 'Allocations' drop-down in the main menu bar. For most users who have not used TACC resources, you will only see the DARPA-SHADE project. Selecting the DARPA-SHADE project will provide additional details, including a list of resource allocations and users associated with the project. Current compute allocations include [Frontera](https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/), [Longhorn](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/longhorn), and [Lonestar6](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/lonestar6). In addition to the 1TB of user/account-specific storage on the shared, Lustre filesystem, Stockyard (mounted on Frontera, Longhorn, and Lonestar6), we have also provisioned storage on Corral where you can share data within and among teams. Below we will discuss access and basic usage.
